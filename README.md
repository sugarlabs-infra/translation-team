# Sugar Labs translation-team issue repository

This is a place to keep track of tasks and scripts useful for the team that supports translations in the Sugar Labs Project

We try to keep all of our workings transparent, in order to facilitate anyone to pick up our tasks as there is much  to be done.

* Our [current tasks](https://github.com/sugarlabs-infra/translation-team/issues)

* Our Team Coordinators, Community Managers, Localization Committe and other community members as translators, technicians and any interested party, may monitor this repository and facilitate advancing this area of work.
